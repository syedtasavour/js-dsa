## About
This repository provides a structured plan to practice Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript for two hours each day. All activities and solutions are documented and pushed to GitHub, allowing transparent progress tracking.

## Routine
1. Identify a set of data structure or algorithm topics.
2. Implement solutions and analyze their complexities.
3. Log challenges, insights, and optimizations.
4. Commit updates to GitHub after each session.

## Scope
Ongoing work spans arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, sorting, and more. Future additions will cover advanced concepts as skills develop.

## Contributing
Suggestions or improvements are encouraged. Pull requests and discussions about performance or alternative approaches are welcome.
